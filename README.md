## Introduction

Determining the accurate market value of a used car is a challenging task due to the numerous variables that influence the price. This project focuses on creating a machine learning model that can predict used car prices based on various features. Users can benefit from this model to make well-informed decisions when buying or selling used cars. The project's objective is to provide a reliable estimate of a car's value based on its characteristics.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is the increasing demand for used cars, particularly during situations like lockdowns when public transportation might be unsafe due to factors like the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people turn to buying second-hand cars as an affordable transportation solution. To help users estimate the prices of used cars, this project employs machine learning algorithms.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assist users in determining whether a used car's asking price is reasonable. It takes into account various factors such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, and more to provide a more accurate estimate of the car's market value. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms and existing data to predict used car prices based on various criteria.

## Scope

The project aims to demonstrate how to develop a model for predicting automobile prices using a machine learning workflow. It utilizes a dataset containing information about various cars to forecast used car prices based on multiple factors.

## System Analysis

The system analysis section of this project provides a detailed examination of the literature, existing systems, and the proposed system. It also outlines the hardware and software requirements for implementing the project.

## System Design

This section delves into the system's architecture and includes data flow diagrams. It also provides insight into the Random Forest algorithm used in the project, along with pseudo-code to explain its operation.

## System Implementation

The system implementation section includes information on the packages and libraries used in the project. It describes the project's modules, data preprocessing, visualization, and pre-modeling steps. It also outlines the data cleaning and feature engineering processes.

## System Evaluation

The system evaluation section discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the machine learning model. It explains metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the R2 score. It also includes plots and a discussion of the results.



## Conclusion

In conclusion, the project's aim is to provide a reliable tool for estimating used car prices, addressing the growing demand for second-hand vehicles. The Random Forest algorithm has shown promising results in this context.

## Future Scope

The future scope of this project includes connecting the machine learning model to real-time data sources for price prediction. It could also involve adding large historical car price datasets to improve the model's accuracy. Additionally, an Android application could be developed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
